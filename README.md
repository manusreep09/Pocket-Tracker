# Project: Pocket Tracker – Personal Finance Dashboard

## This is a web-based dashboard designed to help you track your finances (income and expenses) in a simple and visually clear way.

## Key Features

- Displays monthly income and monthly expenses figures, with a comparison to the last month (e.g., “12% vs Last month”).

- Shows a “My Card” section with the linked wallet/card number and spending limit used vs total.

- Provides a filtered view of yearly data (e.g., income/expenditure for a selected month) and a breakdown by category (Food & Health, Entertainment, Shopping, Investment, etc.).

- Offers different time-views: Daily, Weekly, Monthly.

- Shows recent transactions in a table: date, category, amount, status.

- Provides forms (modal dialogs) for “Add Income” and “Add Expense”, with fields for amount, category (preset options), description and date.

## Purpose

The purpose is to give users a consolidated financial overview: what they earn, what they spend, how the spending is distributed across categories, and how things have changed month-to-month. It also allows the user to record new income and expense entries manually.
